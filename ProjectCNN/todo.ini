* read parameters from a text file
* check the performance on test set
* perform validation on a different validation set
* seperate out the call for implementation using 1D convolution
* seperate out the call for non-sparse implementaton for performance and accuracy testing

mandatory implementation
* generalize the jacobi stencil
* implement sparse network design
* check whether post training, the weight matrix retains its shape, also does it have the matrix co-efficients as the jacobi does.
